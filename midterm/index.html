            <h3>A few extra things about me!</h3>
            <p>I used to do knife/axe throwing on my spare time. I am a huge supporter of small businesses and I want to try to do something to help boost small businesses more. My favourite childhood animes of all time are Shugo Chara and Tokyo Mew Mew.  I am an anime/cartoon nerd, I love going to conventions and collecting fun stuff to add to my room (And hopefully future apartment). My favourite Pokemon is Gengar!. I love drinking vanilla lattes, specifically from Second Cup. I <strong>LOVE</strong> Ahsoka Tano from Star Wars the clone wars. Finally, I would love to travel around the world and get tattoos from each country. I only have one sword tattoo from Scotland but I want to have various different sword tattoos that wrap around my arm as well as nerdy tattoos from talented artists.</p>
