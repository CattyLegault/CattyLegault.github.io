            <p class="main-p">Hello, My name is Catherine Legault but you can call me Cat. I am a 27 year old designer, born on January 21<sup>st</sup>, 1998. I graduated Algonquin College in 2019. Worked for five different companies 2019-2024 such as <abbr title="Name of studios">Cyan Solutions, Algonquin College Marketing Department, Invest Ottawa,</abbr> and recently <abbr title="Name of Studios">Laughing Dragon Studios</abbr> in Montreal from 2022-2024. I volunteered for the Liberal Party as a photographer and currently volunteering for the Ottawa International Animation Festival. I have a dog name Winston and a cat name Sophie. I moved around a lot, I was born in Quebec and stayed for the first five years, moved to Mississauga for eight years, then Ottawa for ten years, only lived in Montreal for two years, then moved BACK to Ottawa this year to go to school.</p>

            <h3>A few extra things about me!</h3>
            <p>I used to do knife/axe throwing on my spare time. I am a huge supporter of small businesses and I want to try to do something to help boost small businesses more. My favourite childhood animes of all time are Shugo Chara and Tokyo Mew Mew.  I am an anime/cartoon nerd, I love going to conventions and collecting fun stuff to add to my room (And hopefully future apartment). My favourite Pokemon is Gengar!. I love drinking vanilla lattes, specifically from Second Cup. I <strong>LOVE</strong> Ahsoka Tano from Star Wars the clone wars. Finally, I would love to travel around the world and get tattoos from each country. I only have one sword tattoo from Scotland but I want to have various different sword tattoos that wrap around my arm as well as nerdy tattoos from talented artists.</p>
