        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello, My name is Catherine Legault but you can call me Cat. I am a 27 year old designer, born on January 21<sup>st</sup>, 1998. I graduated Algonquin College in 2016. Worked for five different companies 2019-2024 such as <abbr title="Name of studios">Cyan Solutions, Algonquin College Marketing Department, Invest Ottawa,</abbr> and recently <abbr title="Name of Studios">Laughing Dragon Studios</abbr> in Montreal from 2022-2024. I volunteered for the Liberal Party as a photographer and currently volunteering for the Ottawa International Animation Festival. I am an anime/cartoon nerd, I love going to conventions and collecting fun stuff to add to my room. I have a dog name Winston and a cat name Sophie. I moved around a lot, I was born in Quebec and stayed for the first five years, moved to Mississauga for eight years, then Ottawa for ten years, only lived in Montreal for two years, then moved BACK to Ottawa this year to go to school. </p>
